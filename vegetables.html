             <h4>Carrot</h4>
             <p>The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, typically orange in color, though
                 heirloom
                 variants including purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars exist,[2][3][4] all of which are
                 domesticated forms of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and Southwestern Asia. The plant
                 probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly
                 eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves are also eaten. The domestic
                 carrot
                 has been selectively bred for its enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.

                 The carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer family, Apiaceae. At birth, it grows a rosette of
                 leaves
                 while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within about three months (90
                 days)
                 of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars need a month longer (120 days). The roots contain
                 high
                 quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, lycopene, anthocyanins, lutein,[5] and are a good source of
                 vitamin
                 A, vitamin K, and vitamin B6. Black carrots are one of the richest sources of anthocyanins (250–300
                 mg/100
                 g fresh root weight), and hence possesses high antioxidant ability i.e. almost 20–35 times higher than
                 red/orange carrots and five times higher than beetroot.[6] </p>

             <h4>Cucumber</h4>
             <p>The cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the family Cucurbitaceae
                 that
                 bears cylindrical to spherical fruits, which are used as culinary vegetables.[1] Considered an annual
                 plant,[2] there are three main types of cucumber—slicing, pickling, and seedless—within which several
                 cultivars have been created. The cucumber originates in Asia extending from India, Nepal, Bangladesh,
                 China
                 (Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi), and Northern Thailand,[3][4][5][6] but now grows on most continents, and
                 many
                 different types of cucumber are grown commercially and traded on the global market. In North America,
                 the
                 term wild cucumber refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, though the two are not
                 closely
                 related. he cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other
                 supporting
                 frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils.[7] The plant may also root in a
                 soilless
                 medium, whereby it will sprawl along the ground in lieu of a supporting structure. The vine has large
                 leaves that form a canopy over the fruits.[citation needed]

                 The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical, but elongated with tapered ends, and
                 may
                 be as large as 62 centimeters (24 in) long and 10 centimeters (4 in) in diameter. </p>

             <h4>Lettuce</h4>
             <p>Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is an annual plant of the family Asteraceae. It is most often grown as a leaf
                 vegetable, but sometimes for its stem and seeds. Lettuce is most often used for salads, although it is
                 also
                 seen in other kinds of food, such as soups, sandwiches and wraps; it can also be grilled.[3] One
                 variety,
                 celtuce (asparagus lettuce), is grown for its stems, which are eaten either raw or cooked. In addition
                 to
                 its main use as a leafy green, it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries
                 of
                 human consumption. Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the
                 late
                 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world. As of 2021, world production
                 of
                 lettuce and chicory was 27 million tonnes, 53 percent of which came from China.[4]

                 Lettuce was originally farmed by the ancient Egyptians, who transformed it from a plant whose seeds
                 were
                 used to obtain oil into an important food crop raised for its succulent leaves and oil-rich seeds.
                 Lettuce
                 spread to the Greeks and Romans; the latter gave it the name lactuca, from which the English lettuce is
                 derived. By 50 AD, many types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings,
                 including
                 several herbals. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many varieties in Europe, and
                 by
                 the mid-18th century, cultivars were described that can still be found in modern gardens. </p>

             <h4>Broccoli</h4>
             <p>Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) is an edible green plant in the cabbage family (family
                 Brassicaceae, genus Brassica) whose large flowering head, stalk and small associated leaves are eaten
                 as a
                 vegetable. Broccoli is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the species Brassica oleracea.
                 Broccoli
                 has large flower heads, usually dark green, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from a
                 thick
                 stalk which is usually light green. The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves. Broccoli
                 resembles
                 cauliflower, which is a different but closely related cultivar group of the same Brassica species.

                 It can be eaten either raw or cooked. Broccoli is a particularly rich source of vitamin C and vitamin
                 K.
                 Contents of its characteristic sulfur-containing glucosinolate compounds, isothiocyanates and
                 sulforaphane,
                 are diminished by boiling but are better preserved by steaming, microwaving or stir-frying.

                 Rapini, sometimes called "broccoli rabe", is a distinct species from broccoli, forming similar but
                 smaller
                 heads, and is actually a type of turnip (Brassica rapa). </p>
