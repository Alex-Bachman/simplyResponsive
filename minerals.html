             <h4>Diamond</h4>
             <p>Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called
                 diamond
                 cubic. Another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form of carbon at room
                 temperature and pressure, but diamond is metastable and converts to it at a negligible rate under those
                 conditions. Diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material,
                 properties
                 that are used in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools. They are also the
                 reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures found deep in the Earth.

                 Because the arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid, few types of impurity can contaminate
                 it
                 (two exceptions are boron and nitrogen). Small numbers of defects or impurities (about one per million
                 of
                 lattice atoms) color diamond blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), brown (defects), green (radiation
                 exposure),
                 purple, pink, orange, or red. Diamond also has a very high refractive index and a relatively high
                 optical
                 dispersion. </p>

             <h4>C=Calcite</h4>
             <p>Calcite is a carbonate mineral and the most stable polymorph of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). It is a very
                 common mineral, particularly as a component of limestone. Calcite defines hardness 3 on the Mohs scale
                 of
                 mineral hardness, based on scratch hardness comparison. Large calcite crystals are used in optical
                 equipment, and limestone composed mostly of calcite has numerous uses.

                 Other polymorphs of calcium carbonate are the minerals aragonite and vaterite. Aragonite will change to
                 calcite over timescales of days or less at temperatures exceeding 300 °C, and vaterite is even less
                 stable. Calcite is derived from the German Calcit, a term from the 19th century that came from the
                 Latin
                 word for lime, calx (genitive calcis) with the suffix -ite used to name minerals. It is thus a doublet
                 of
                 the word chalk.

                 When applied by archaeologists and stone trade professionals, the term alabaster is used not just as in
                 geology and mineralogy, where it is reserved for a variety of gypsum; but also for a similar-looking,
                 translucent variety of fine-grained banded deposit of calcite. </p>

             <h4>Quartz</h4>
             <p>Quartz is a hard, crystalline mineral composed of silica (silicon dioxide). The atoms are linked in a
                 continuous framework of SiO4 silicon–oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen being shared between two
                 tetrahedra, giving an overall chemical formula of SiO2. Quartz is, therefore, classified structurally
                 as a
                 framework silicate mineral and compositionally as an oxide mineral. Quartz is the second most abundant
                 mineral in Earth's continental crust, behind feldspar.[10]

                 Quartz exists in two forms, the normal α-quartz and the high-temperature β-quartz, both of which are
                 chiral. The transformation from α-quartz to β-quartz takes place abruptly at 573 °C (846 K; 1,063 °F).
                 Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume, it can easily induce
                 microfracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature threshold.

                 There are many different varieties of quartz, several of which are classified as gemstones. Since
                 antiquity, varieties of quartz have been the most commonly used minerals in the making of jewelry and
                 hardstone carvings, especially in Europe and Asia.

                 Quartz is the mineral defining the value of 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness, a qualitative scratch
                 method
                 for determining the hardness of a material to abrasion. </p>

             <h4>Barite</h4>
             <p>The radiating form, sometimes referred to as Bologna Stone,[9] attained some notoriety among alchemists
                 for
                 specimens found in the 17th century near Bologna by Vincenzo Casciarolo. These became phosphorescent
                 upon
                 being calcined.

                 Carl Scheele determined that baryte contained a new element in 1774, but could not isolate barium, only
                 barium oxide. Johan Gottlieb Gahn also isolated barium oxide two years later in similar studies. Barium
                 was
                 first isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts in 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy in England.

                 The American Petroleum Institute specification API 13/ISO 13500, which governs baryte for drilling
                 purposes, does not refer to any specific mineral, but rather a material that meets that specification.
                 In practice, however, this is usually the mineral baryte.

                 The term "primary barytes" refers to the first marketable product, which includes crude baryte (run of
                 mine) and the products of simple beneficiation methods, such as washing, jigging, heavy media
                 separation,
                 tabling, and flotation. Most crude baryte requires some upgrading to minimum purity or density. Baryte
                 that
                 is used as an aggregate in a "heavy" cement is crushed and screened to a uniform size. Most baryte is
                 ground to a small, uniform size before it is used as a filler or extender, an addition to industrial
                 products, in the production of barium chemicals or as a weighting agent in petroleum well drilling mud.
