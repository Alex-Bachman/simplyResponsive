             <h4>Sloth</h4>
             <p>Their limbs are adapted for hanging and grasping, not for supporting their weight. Muscle mass makes up
                 only 25 to 30 percent of their total body weight. Most other mammals have a muscle mass that makes up
                 40 to 45 percent of their total body weight. Their specialised hands and feet have long, curved
                 claws to allow them to hang upside down from branches without effort, and are used to drag
                 themselves along the ground, since they cannot walk. On three-toed sloths, the arms are 50 percent
                 longer than the legs.

                 Sloths move only when necessary and even then very slowly. They usually move at an average speed of 4
                 metres (13 ft) per minute, but can move at a marginally higher speed of 4.5 metres (15 ft) per minute
                 if they are in immediate danger from a predator. While they sometimes sit on top of branches, they
                 usually eat, sleep, and even give birth hanging from branches. They sometimes remain hanging from
                 branches even after death. On the ground, the maximum speed of sloths is 3 metres (9.8 ft) per minute.
                 Two-toed sloths are generally better able than three-toed sloths to disperse between clumps of trees on
                 the ground. </p>

             <h4>Cow</h4>
             <p>The term Cattle was borrowed from Anglo-Norman catel, itself from medieval Latin capitale 'principal sum
                 of money, capital', itself derived in turn from Latin caput 'head'. Cattle originally meant movable
                 personal property, especially livestock of any kind, as opposed to real property (the land, which also
                 included wild or small free-roaming animals such as chickens—they were sold as part of the
                 land). The word is a variant of chattel (a unit of personal property) and closely related to
                 capital in the economic sense.

                 The word cow came via Anglo-Saxon cū (plural cȳ), from Common Indo-European gʷōus (genitive gʷowés) 'a
                 bovine animal', cf. Persian: gâv, Sanskrit: go-, Welsh: buwch.[22] The plural cȳ became ki or kie in
                 Middle English, and an additional plural ending was often added, giving kine, kien, but also kies, kuin
                 and others. This is the origin of the now archaic English plural, kine. The Scots language singular is
                 coo or cou, and the plural is kye.

                 In older English sources such as the King James Version of the Bible, cattle refers to livestock, as
                 opposed to deer which refers to wildlife. Wild cattle may refer to feral cattle or to undomesticated
                 species of the genus Bos. When used without a qualifier, the modern meaning of cattle is usually
                 restricted to domesticated bovines. </p>

             <h4>Bear</h4>
             <p>Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have also been used for
                 bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their powerful
                 physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of
                 various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their
                 habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear
                 species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at
                 risk of extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened
                 populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.</p>

             <h4>Chicken</h4>
             <p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered, and the
                 wings are short. Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow
                 them to fly more than a short distance. Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[17] Adult
                 chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps
                 of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males.
                 Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a
                 beard.

                 Chickens are omnivores. In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and
                 animals as large as lizards, small snakes, and young mice. A chicken may live for 5–10 years,
                 depending on the breed. The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years. </p>
